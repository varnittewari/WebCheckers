    <h2>Setup and Object of Checkers</h2>

    <ul>

    Checkers is played on a standard 64 square board. Only the 32 dark colored squares are used in play. Each player
    begins the game with 12 pieces, or checkers, placed in the three rows closest to him or her.

    The object of the game is to capture all of your opponent's checkers or position your pieces so that your opponent
    has no available moves.

    </ul>

    <h2>Movement</h2>

    <ul>

    Basic movement is to move a checker one space diagonally forward. You can not move a checker backwards until it
    becomes a King, as described below. If a jump is available, you must take the jump, as described in the next
    question and answer.

    </ul>

    <h2>Jumping</h2>

    <ul>
    If one of your opponent's checkers is on a forward diagonal next to one of your checkers, and the next space beyond
    the opponent's checker is empty, then your checker must jump the opponent's checker and land in the space beyond.
    Your opponent's checker is captured and removed from the board.

    After making one jump, your checker might have another jump available from its new position. Your checker must take
    that jump too. It must continue to jump until there are no more jumps available. Both men and kings are allowed to
    make multiple jumps.

    If, at the start of a turn, more than one of your checkers has a jump available, then you may decide which one you
    will move. But once you have chosen one, it must take all the jumps that it can.

    </ul>

    <h2>You Must Jump If Possible</h2>

    <ul>
    If a jump is available for one of your pieces, you must make that jump. If more jumps are available with that same
    piece, you must continue to jump with it until it can jump no more. To make the second and third jump with a piece,
    you do not need to click that piece again. Just click the next space to which it will jump.

    If more than one of your pieces has a jump available at the start of your turn, you can choose which piece you will
    move. But then you must make all the jumps available for that piece.

    </ul>

    <h2>Crowning</h2>

    <ul>
    When one of your checkers reaches the opposite side of the board, it is crowned and becomes a King. Your turn ends
    there.

    A King can move backward as well as forward along the diagonals. It can only move a distance of one space.

    A King can also jump backward and forward. It must jump when possible, and it must take all jumps that are available
    to it. In each jump, the King can only jump over one opposing piece at a time, and it must land in the space just
    beyond the captured piece. The King can not move multiple spaces before or after jumping a piece.

    </ul>

    <h2>Starting A Game of Checkers Here</h2>

    <ul>

    As the site is opened, a prompt comes up to sign in with a name. The name must not have any special characters or
    it should not have been used before by other player who is currently signed in.
    Once signed in, it gives a list of players online and one can choose whoever he or she wants to play with provided
    they are already not in the middle of the game.
    Once a player is chosen, and "play game" is clicked, it takes the two players to the game page where the board is
    present and the game can be played.

    </ul>

    <h2>Moving Pieces on the Board</h2>

    <ul>

    After a game of checkers is created, you may go to it any time by clicking your opponent's name as it appears on
    your game status page.

    If it is your turn, you will see a message above the board telling it is your move.

    To begin your turn, click a checker that you want to move. Remember, if a jump is available, you must take it.
    After you click a checker that you want to move, hold it and move it to the space where you want to move it. If
    it is a legal move then you can leave the piece at that space, otherwise it will go back to the original space. A
    new page will load showing the checker moved.

    If you have made a jump and another jump is available with that same checker, you will see the message on the top
    saying it is your turn and the Submit button would still be not available. To do a multi-jump, move it to each
    step of the jump, in order, one at a time.

    When you are through, a Submit button will appear above the board. You must click a submit button to finish your
    move.

    You can press Backup to undo the last movement you made.

    </ul>

    <h2>When a Piece Will Not Move</h2>

    <ul>

    Sometimes, you may find that you can not click on a checkers piece to move it. When this happens, look at the board
    carefully. You probably have a jump available with a different piece. If this is the case, then you must jump with
    the piece that has the jump. Also, you must take every jump that a piece has available.

    </ul>
